# pandas-challenge

This code was created based on the pieces of code provided and whit the help of pandas.pydata.com this page was really helpful. I use chat GPT, youtube videos, and the exercises from class.
 
When I started coding with "groupby", I use two lines of code to get the outcome, but when I did more, I discovered that I could have the same outcome with one line of code. I left those two lines in the code as a reminder of the logic of "gropuby".

Thank you.
